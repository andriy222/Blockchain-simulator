title: Blockchain with Java
language: English
summary: "<p>Blockchains are data structures where blocks are inseparably connected.\
  \ What makes blockchains so special is the security level they offer due to the\
  \ way they are constructed. Blockchains are unhackable, so it makes perfect sense\
  \ why cryptocurrency makes use of this technology. In this project, you will try\
  \ yourself at making a microcosm where virtual miners earn cryptocurrency and exchange\
  \ messages and transactions using blockchain. You will practice concepts frequently\
  \ tested in technical interviews at top tech companies.</p>"
